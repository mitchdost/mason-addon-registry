# mason-addon-registry

This is meant as additional source for mason packages.

The primary goal is this repo to be empty. If packages are needed a PR should be made at [mason-registry].

For the packages in transition or for rejected PRs this repo might be used.

For development on mason packages see [mason-registry CONTRIBUTING.md].
